# TimeBomb-Widget
TimeBomb Widget is a fun countdown timer widget with fun beep sounds to notify the cowntown has started and a BOOM to notfify the timer has ended.

## How to Use:
* To open the widget double click on the executable file. I suggest you pin the icon to taskbar for easy access.
* Click and hold just below the timer display to drag the widget around your screen and place it wherever convenient.
* Manually enter the time as minutes and seconds into the timer.
* Press the Red button to initiate countdown.
* press the Blue Button to pause the timer (It will be red when paused, blue when unpaused).
* Once the bomb blasts and timer reaches 00:00 , right click on the widget and click on close to cose the widget.

## Features yet to Add:
I have to add the reset timer functionality so that it takes in input, again after the timer reaches 00:00 . So that we dont need to close window and open it again.
